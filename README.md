# Deblurring-and-Denoising
## Signals and Systems Coursework Project


This code is a Python script for signal processing tasks. It imports the necessary libraries such as pandas for reading a CSV file, matplotlib for plotting signals, and numpy for complex numbers and mathematical functions. The script reads data from a CSV file and extracts the x[n] and y[n] signals.

The code defines an impulse response h[n] with predefined values. It also includes functions for denoising the signal, calculating the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), and calculating the inverse DTFT. The script further includes a function for deblurring the signal, which compares two methods and calculates the standard deviation and root mean square error.

The script performs signal processing operations on the original signals x[n] and y[n]. It denoises and deblurs the signals using the defined functions and generates new signals x1[n] and x2[n]. Finally, it plots a comparison between the original signal x[n], denoised and deblurred signal x1[n], and deblurred and denoised signal x2[n]. The graph helps visualize the effects of the signal processing operations.

Overall, this script showcases signal processing techniques such as denoising and deblurring using the Discrete Time Fourier Transform, providing insights into the comparison and analysis of different signal processing methods.
